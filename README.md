# **VIPE Unity SDK**

Welcome to the VIPE Unity SDK! This toolkit is designed to provide Unity developers with a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for integrating NFT avatars into their projects. With support for Unity 2021.3.12f1 and later versions, our SDK facilitates the use of both open-source and personal NFT avatars directly from your digital wallet.

## **Key Features**

- **Log-In Capabilities:** Choose between guest access for a quick start with open-source VRM avatars or log in with your VIPE account to access avatars from your associated wallet.
- **Seamless Usage:** Easily start the scene, log in or join as a guest, and select your preferred VRM avatar for an immersive experience.
- **Troubleshooting Assistance:** If your VRM avatar doesn't appear immediately, we provide simple steps to locate and load it from the Unity Asset folder.
